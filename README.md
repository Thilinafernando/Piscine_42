-Shell Projects: we started with shell exercises to learn how to use bash, navigate through Linux, and get comfortable working in the terminal.

-C Projects: then came C, to understand how coding works at a lower level, get introduced to Unix concepts, and build a strong programming foundation.

-Rush Weekends: teamwork challenges where we had to build structured, readable code together and learn how to integrate different parts of a project smoothly.
